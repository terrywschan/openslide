# OpenSlide

OpenSlide is a C library for reading whole slide image files (also known as
virtual slides).  It provides a consistent and simple API for reading files
from multiple vendors.


## Features

OpenSlide can read brightfield whole slide images in [several formats][]:

* [Aperio][] (`.svs`, `.tif`)
* [Hamamatsu][] (`.ndpi`, `.vms`, `.vmu`)
* [Leica][] (`.scn`)
* [MIRAX][] (`.mrxs`)
* [Philips][] (`.tiff`)
* [Sakura][] (`.svslide`)
* [Trestle][] (`.tif`)
* [Ventana][] (`.bif`, `.tif`)
* [Generic tiled TIFF][] (`.tif`)

OpenSlide can also provide access to textual metadata, as well as
associated images such as a slide label and thumbnail.
